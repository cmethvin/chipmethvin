                    <h4>Principal Software Engineer <span>Feb 2019&ndash;Present</span></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Primarily responsible for developing and maintaining IU's Interactive Graduation Planning System (iGPS), a set of Java/React web application modules
                            designed to help students, with the assistance of their advisors, to do short-term and long-term planning of courses
                            throughout their college career so that they're able to finish their degrees on time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Completed a rewrite of the iGPS web application from a monolith to a microservice architecture with a React front-end.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Converted the iGPS Course Search back-end from a custom-built search index with limited features
                            to a much more feature-rich Elasticsearch index, which led to the retirement of alternative course search solutions
                            in use across IU's campuses and widespread adoption of the iGPS Course Search application.
                        </li>

                            advisors to filter on class meeting times and days, general education requirements, online vs. in person classes, instructor,
                            and many other options.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Meet periodically with development leads on other teams and our enterprise architect to discuss current or upcoming issues.
